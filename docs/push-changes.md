# OS-Climate Data Commons Developer Guide: Push changes

Note to say a few words about pull-requests, commits, pushes, etc. and how to play nicely with CD/CI environment.

It is a Red Hat best practice for individual contributors to fork, rather than clone, their repositories: https://redhat-cop.github.io/contrib/local-setup.html.  TL;DR: if you are maintining the repo for the project, it's OK to clone.  But in all other cases, it's better to fork and submit pull requests that convey the changes in your forked repository to the branch against which you wish to merge.
