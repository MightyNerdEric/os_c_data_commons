# OS-C Data Commons Architecture Blueprint

## Overview

![OS-C Data Commons Platform Overview](https://github.com/os-climate/os_c_data_commons/blob/main/images/architecture/COP26-Overview-Technical.png)

The overall architecture approach is based on a distributed data mesh architecture, with a focus on addressing the key problems we face in the climate data domain with regards to the proliferation of data sources and consumers, the diversity and complexity of data transformation requirements, and the speed of both scaling and change required. It is recommended to read the following foundational articles to understand the concept and approach towards building a data mesh:

> [How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh][1]
> -- <cite>Zhamak Dehghani, Thoughtworks</cite>

> [Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture][2]
> -- <cite>Zhamak Dehghani, Thoughtworks</cite>

The Data Commons implementation is based on 3 foundational principles:

1. **Self-service data infrastructure as a platform:** The platform provides standardized self-service infrastructure and tooling for creating, maintaining and managing data products, for communities of data scientists and developers who may not have the technology capability or time to handle infrastructure provisioning, data storage and security, data pipeline orchestration and management or product integration.

2. **Domain-oriented decentralized data product ownership:** Data ownership is decentralized and domain data product owners are responsible for all capabilities within a given domain, including discoverability, understandability, quality and security of the data. In effect this is achieved by having agile, autonomous, distributed teams building data pipelines as code and data product interfaces on standard tooling and shared infrastructure services. These teams own the code for data pipelines loading, transforming and serving the data as well as the related metadata, and drive the development cycle for their own data domains. This is reflected and built into our DataOps / DevOps organization and processes, with contributor team structure, access to the platform and data management capabilities supporting autonomous collaborative development for the various data streams within OS-Climate.

3. **Federated governance:** The platform requires a layer providing a federated view of the data domains while being able to support the establishment of common operating standards around data / metadata / data lineage management, quality assurance, security and compliance policies, and by extension any cross-cutting supervision concern across all data products. 

## Component Architecture

This section covers the key open source technology components on which the Data Commons platform is built. To do this, we segregate two views:

1. [Data Management Platform](./docs/component-architecture-data-platform.md)
2. [Data Science Platform](./docs/component-architecture-data-science.md)

It is important to understand that all technology components are not only evaluated and selected based on features and design requirements, but also considering open source projects that:

- Have an "upstream first" approach. For more information on open source upstream and why upstream first is an important approach, this [blog post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-open-source-upstream) does a good job at explaining the various concepts.  
- Have an active, diverse community contributing to the development and use of the technology, including some enterprise usage at scale.
- Ideally, for critical online components of the system, the possibility to get enterprise versions and support, considering a medium to long term requirement could be for some OS-Climate members to run the platform within their own regulated environment.

## Guiding Principles

These guiding principles are used for a consistent approach in linking together not just the platform / tools components but also the people and process aspects of data as managed through OS-Climate Data Commons:

1. **Data as code:** All data and data handling logic should be treated as code. Creation, deprecation, and critical changes to data artifacts should go through a design review process with appropriate written documents where the community of contributors as well as data consumersâ€™ views are taken into account. Changes in data sources, schema, pipeline logic have mandatory reviewers who sign off before changes are landed. Data artifacts have tests associated with them and are continuously tested. The same practices we apply to software code versioning and management are employed.

2. **Data is owned:** Data and data pipelines are code and all code must be owned. Source data loading and normalisation pipelines are managed in dedicated code repositories with a clear owner, purpose and list of contributors. Likewise, data analytics pipelines providing inputs to scenario analysis and alignment tooling are managed in dedicated code repositories with a clear owner, purpose, list of contributors and defined data management lifecycle including data security and documented process for publishing, sharing and using the data.

3. **Data quality is measured, reviewed and managed:** Data artifacts must have SLAs for data quality, SLAs for data issues remediation, and incident reporting and management just like for any technology service. This means that for machine learning models, it is required to implement business driven data validation rules on the independent and target variables as part of a continuous integration and deployment pipeline, by monitoring the statistical properties of variables over the period of time and by continuously re-fitting the models to handle potential drift. The owner is responsible for quality and upholding those SLAs to the rest of the OS-C Data Commons user community.

4. **Accelerate data productivity:** The Data Commons platform and data tooling provided must be designed to optimise collaboration between data producers and consumers. Data tooling includes ETL tools, data integration, data management including data storage, data lineage and data access management, data pipeline development tools supporting the writing and execution of tests, automation of the data pipeline by following MLOps methodology, and integration with the existing monitoring / auditing capabilities of the platform. All the tooling used should be open source so as to not restrict usage for any contributing organization, and delivered following the Operate First principle (more at [https://www.operate-first.cloud/](https://www.operate-first.cloud/)) which means the platform development and productisation process must include building the required operational knowledge for deploying and managing the platform, and encapsulating it in the software itself.

5. **Organise for data:** Teams contributing to data pipeline development on OS-C Data Commons platform should be self-sufficient in managing the whole lifecycle of development which includes onboarding contributors, provisioning required infrastructure for development, testing and data processing, managing functional dependencies such as dependencies on other data pipeline streams, and managing their code repositories. In order to support this, the OS-C Data Commons platform follows a model of self-service built around the OS-C Data Commons platform GitHub repository where contributors and all code (platform, data pipelines) is managed and working instances of the Data Commons platform running on self-service infrastructure and tightly integrated with the code base.

## Architectural Domain Design Drivers
